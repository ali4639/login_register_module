# login_register_module
Login and register module using HTML,CSS and JavaScript</br>
I am Ali Azarban, a senior student of software engineering from Islamic Azad University, Urmia Branch, Iran.</br>
Today I have done another project within the previous project and in order to do it.</br>
Today, in this project, the main part of a website is that I have simulated login and registration, although the designed form sends information or authenticates, but my intention and purpose in this tutorial was to create two forms side by side. I have a fever as well. I hope you see and use the codes. In future trainings and projects, authentication and validation of the form will also be provided.
